# P11 — Cloud-safe Introductions workflow (consent + templates + outcomes + graph edges)

## Implementation notes
- Added an in-memory introductions store with request details, consent policy, consent records, and outcome tracking.
- Outcomes write timeline events into the interactions store and create relationship edges with introduced-by attribution.
- Added RU/EN intro message templates with tokenized previews and workspace-level persistence.

## UX coverage
- Introductions board groups requests by status and shows ask/context, consent policy, and consent states.
- Timeline events section highlights intro outcome events for quick follow-up.
- Message templates panel previews RU/EN copy and allows editing workspace templates.

## API surface
- `POST /api/introductions/templates` updates workspace introduction templates (role-gated).

## Privacy and RBAC
- Workspace scoping enforced in introduction listings and updates.
- Template updates require introduction coordination access.

## Key files
- `lib/introductions.ts`
- `app/(app)/introductions/page.tsx`
- `components/introductions/*`
- `app/api/introductions/templates/route.ts`
- `__tests__/introductions.test.ts`
