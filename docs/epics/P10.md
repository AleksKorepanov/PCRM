# P10 — Cloud-safe Needs/Offers + matching + weekly digest (RU/EN)

## Implementation notes
- Added an in-memory Needs/Offers store with CRUD helpers, confidentiality filtering, geo constraints, and expiry handling.
- Implemented a deterministic, rule-based matching engine that stores scores, reasons, and RU/EN explanations.
- Added digest data builders and workspace-level template settings for weekly digest generation.

## UX coverage
- Needs/Offers board shows open needs and offers with confidentiality badges, geo labels, and expiry.
- Matches panel shows the “why” explanation and quick actions for follow-up.
- Weekly digest panel renders RU/EN copy-ready text and allows updating workspace templates.

## API surface
- `POST /api/needs-offers/templates` updates workspace digest templates (role-gated).

## Privacy and RBAC
- Visibility filtering ensures private and restricted entries are only visible to authorized users.
- Digest and match listings inherit confidentiality rules to prevent leakage.

## Key files
- `lib/needs-offers.ts`
- `lib/needs-offers-digest.ts`
- `app/(app)/needs-offers/page.tsx`
- `components/needs-offers/*`
- `app/api/needs-offers/templates/route.ts`
