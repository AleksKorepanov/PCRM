# P09 — Cloud-safe commitments register + reliability index + overdue

## Implementation notes
- Added an in-memory commitments store with party roles (owed by, owes to, observer) plus CRUD helpers, snapshots, and contact reassignment for merges.
- Implemented overdue detection and reliability metrics (on-time closure ratio and overdue rate) for contact profiles.
- Seeded sample commitments to populate the commitments board and contact commitment tab.

## UX coverage
- Commitments board renders columns by status, shows party roles, and highlights overdue items.
- Contact profile displays reliability stats and a commitments tab with per-contact commitments.

## API surface
- No API endpoints added yet; commitments are handled via in-memory store helpers.

## Privacy and RBAC
- Role-gated commitment mutations via helper functions; read-only roles cannot create, update, or delete commitments.
